# NEXUS FX - All-in-One Brokerage Platform

The future of Forex brokerage. Launch your fully licensed brokerage or trade with institutional-grade tools.

## What is NEXUS FX?

### Our Mission

To democratize access to professional trading infrastructure by providing a turnkey brokerage platform that enables anyone to launch and operate their own Forex brokerage—without needing technical expertise, developers, or complex infrastructure.

- **Complete Solution**: Everything you need is included—from dealing desk and price feeds to CRM, KYC, and payment processing.

### Guiding Principles

1. **Accessibility**: Professional-grade trading infrastructure should be available to everyone, not just large institutions.
